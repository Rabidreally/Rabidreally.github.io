<h4>20/11/24</h4>

<h3>
    <p>I look outside my window, and I look up. There are no stars. There are no clouds. There is nothing but void, and that isâ€¦ wrong.</p>
    <p>I wonder too often about my passing. It is a sign, to point to a pattern, that I am in a bad place at the moment. Yet I don't know as I did before that I could even consider making that decision. It is also not the first time that I have expressed this sentiment; one of lacking the will, lacking the courage, lacking the apathy. But I would wish to say that there is something unique about today, and about how my mind thinks to think. Because if there weren't, then I couldn't say that I have changed at all in the past year.</p>
    <p>I have changed. How would that be known after my death? How would anyone know who I am or who I was or who I could be if all they see is the fragment that I show to the world? They wouldn't presume I have changed very much, because stagnation in the recess of presumed life has become my brand. A constant of secure choices, of bland life. It is not that I have a problem with that presentation, because it is who I chose to be for them, and it is in part who I have become because of them. But to think that in memoriam, all I shall be in discussion is a sentence of summary, aches a heart who assumed otherwise of agony.</p>
    <p>The sky is so much more than that darkness that presides over it tonight. Yet to someone who hadn't before seen the true beauty of the stars that inhabit it, who'd only known the grey of concrete and the white of artificial lights? They would never know. They would never aspire to guess at the universe and its mysteries. Should they not be content to accept that version as reality?</p>
    <p>Or should they look once more on another night? Perhaps look closer, through a different lens. I don't know if I would. Because how can you know what is missing without a hint first? Most who live in ignorance do not do so out of choice, but rather lack of choice.</p>
    <p>So I wish for others to know who I really am after I pass. But how should I expect them to know without inviting them to see? A couple stars at first, perhaps even a cloud. Then perhaps they will figure out on their own what more there is to know. What more of the universe there is to see. And the truths that seemed so obvious could crumble under the weight of a learnt reality. Then I could rest knowing that, even beyond my time to control my image, they do know me.</p>
