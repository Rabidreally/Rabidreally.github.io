    <p>I'm not sure if this is a universal experience or not. I'll assume it is to some degree. Sometimes, when my mind runs dry of topics of thought, a particular phrase starts to take root and repeat itself over and over. Just imagine having one bar or one part of a song stuck in your head. It's that same issue.</p>
    <p>What I'm more interested in is the adaptation that phrase has undergone over time. If I were a therapist, it would be the kind of thing I would analyse for a deeper meaning in application to my mental state. I'm not. But I'll probably try to draw some wild assessments anyway.</p>
    <p>The first time I took note of this was a while ago, and I have an older journal entry from around that time. I'll put it below:</p>
    <p><em>I am not depressed. Not as of writing this.</p>
    <p>I have known depression, struggled with it a few times, almost lost twice. In those periods, I recognised the briefness of the sorrows, of the anger that took me. I saw the farce of misery for what it was, and that brought me through it. I knew that once I reached the other side, a happier, fuller life would greet me.</p>
    <p>And to some extent, they did. I can also say that in contrast to some of the pervasive darkness I felt, that I think everyone deals with at one point or another, I also came to understand joy. </p>
    <p>There were times when I would sit in bed, look up at the ceiling and say to myself: “It doesn't get better from here. But that's good, that's great. Because I am right where I want to be.”</p>
    <p>Neither point is where I am now. I wish I could point to an instigating event that caused this mindset I seem so bent on now, but as far as I can tell there is nothing.</p>
    <p>That's not true.</p>
    <p>As I think more I know what has caused me to become so disconnected. It has to do with a mantra that has gone through my head more times than I can count in the past six months.</p>
    <p>Variations therefore persist but the crux and core is this. </p>
    <p>“I am a bad person.”</p>
    <p>“I am a shitty person.”</p>
    <p>“I am an awful person.”</p>
    <p>Now I have yet to decide how deep I wish to delve into specifics. Especially with names, especially with people.</p>
    <p>All I will say here is that while I do not necessarily push people away in a consistent manner, I am terrible at maintaining relationships. At putting in the effort beyond basic requirements. Actually messaging people back.</p>
    <p>If basic a problem, it is indicative of much of my 'struggles' currently. Every time I do something bad, fuck up with someone I care for, I dig myself deeper into this hole. It's not even one that I so wholly care to get out of, but it leads to me fucking up again, still obsessed over the last one and unable to rectify my own flaws.</p>
    <p>Anyways, I am not depressed. So many side tangents to go on to explain everything, apologies.</p>
    <p>I am not depressed, but I do hate myself. I hate how I am the antithesis of the person I preach myself to be, the person I preach others should. Is it contrary to state that I feel nothing but also I feel hatred in back to back sentences?</p>
    <p>Maybe. I stopped trying to define in such simple terms any one person a while back. Humans are complicated, capable of more than one passing mentality. Capable of intense stupidity, as I prove now.</em></p>
    <p>This was an… interesting period of my life. I was lost, as I recognise I am now, but I was not searching for meaning. I have also cut off the next couple paragraphs, as they discuss more unsavoury matters. It is likely no surprise that I was, contrary to my statement, incredibly depressed when I wrote this too. Possibly more so than I have ever been.</p>
    <p>I think it is valuable to know that depression cannot be confined to a sense of moroseness, although it often takes that form, but also this distinct lack of will. This is a commonly stated symptom, although the way in which it manifests can be obscure. Rather than an inability to get out of bed, more an inability to hold a conversation. It would seem like the strength required for that was entirely too demanding.</p>
    <p>Regardless, this phrase. <em>“I am a bad person.”</em></p>
    <p>It almost comes across as too on the nose. I have another excerpt that I wish to insert here which may prove interesting to read:</p>
    <p><em>I do not think there exists such a thing as a good or a bad person.</p>
    <p>I don't know how much I wish to justify this but thinking it through got me a long way. Of course, looking at where I am now, perhaps that wasn't for the best.</p>
    <p>But I think it is an important thought, idea. Because how can we condemn any person to live a life constructed by what we think they should be?</p>
    <p>If there is a moral to these particular ramblings then this is what I have to offer.</p>
    <p>People are stupid. We suffer, in silence or in wailing screams, so we or others thrive. Only when the suffering stops can the brain run loud enough to suffocate. That is the point of concern. The aftermath of the storm reveals the damage far worse than can be seen during.</p>
    <p>And that damage is mendable. A wreck can become whole again in even the worst, most vile place, in the most unredeemable person. And yet, a place of beauty, a person whose values appear unshakable, whose mirth runs rivers, can always find themselves destroyed by a storm unknown to them. Can always become a haven to spread damage upon others.</em></p>
    <p>And this was my core philosophy for a while. I don't especially find it resonates with me anymore, although I am fond of the idea. It would be nice to believe, which is why I think that I held that as true before, even as conflicting as it was for me at the time.</p>
    <p>I wouldn't say I have a philosophy or guiding principles right now. Which lines up more cohesively with the present-day mantra.</p>
    <p>There are no variations of this one. Just simply: <em>“I don't know who I am.”</em></p>
    <p>The thoughts then following are a cacophony of differing interpretations of my own psyche, perspectives overlapping as a river, meaning eroded as the bank. It is perhaps the most ironic phrase I could have running through my head, because I have made such a big deal about realising my gender identity and less so my sexuality that it feels awful to not have the same assurance on the matter of far more import -- me.</p>
    <p>But that is not putting it well enough either. Because the shards, this is a metaphor I quite like by the way, you'll see it in my other writing, the shards that compose me are so easy to identify. I know what parts of me believe, enjoy, feel sorrow. And I know why their compositions and formations are so. But it is as soon as I collate the shards into something resembling a whole that I realise that I am not whole. There is always something missing. And the jagged edges never align.</p>
    <p>An astute reader might quote something back to me that I wrote in my first pasted section. <em>”Humans are complicated, capable of more than one passing mentality.”</em></p>
    <p>More than anything, today, I want truth. It is my deepest desire to find something to latch onto that I can know is right. So it is not enough for me to handwave away such an urge. Would a scientist leave the quantum field because it is too complicated?</p>
    <p>Okay well yes, a ton did and still do. Fair enough on their parts.</p>
    <p>Putting aside the then and the now, there is definitive observation to be made about the shifting of mindsets. If I had to quantify it, I would say that it's a step forward. Because I still hate myself. That is like almost a universal constant. I still regret my actions, my words, most importantly my unsaid words. And I don't forgive myself.</p>
    <p>But what I am able to do is get out of bed. I'm able to walk to lectures, sit there for an hour without even once closing my eyes to the image of my body hanging limp from a noose.</p>
    <p>What I am able to do is concern myself with matters so unimportant as self-reflection whilst fulfilling my expected actions, whilst presenting an unbroken facade to the outside world, whilst writing with rational fear rather than deep hollow melancholy.</p>
    <p>What I am able to do is keep living.</p>
    <p>And perhaps, for now, that is enough.</p>
