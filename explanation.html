<h1>Explanation</h1>

<h3>
    <p>Think of this site as a repository. Or an archive. Esentially I have a lot of thoughts, too many, and I really like writing.</p>
    <p>But google docs is really annoying for me to sort through and find old stuff, because I have a spam ton of random documents and work stuff.</p>
    <p>So all of the entires I'm proud of for one reason or another, I'll store here. I'll make it accessible for others to look through because if it's interesting enough to me, then anyone who cares enough to read it might also find it interesting.</p>
    <p>I can't be asked to make the website look great, but I know some very basic html/css so yeah. Here's a picture of a hot dog.</p>
