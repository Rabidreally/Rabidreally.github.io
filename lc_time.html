<h1>Time</h1>
<br>
<h4>25/11/24</h4>

<h3>
    <p>Life has never felt so impermanent before. I blink, and a day has passed. I try to feel sorrow at the lost time, but I am met with something close to apathy. This fog in my mind that secludes the present from the moment. That abstracts living from life.</p>
    <p>I don't know when I last cried. Beyond a forced tear, a nod to the visage one should present when mourning the death of self, or the joy at rebirth in a forever dreamed upon light. I know when I was young I would cry all the time. At some point I must have blinked the habit away with the days.</p>
    <p>Where does that leave me? Wishing for my soul to shatter, such that I could stand before it and examine each and every shard. When every other manner of self-examination has failed, I need truth which reality cannot provide.</p>
    <p>Is that why I write? </p>
    <p>This is fiction, after all. No word can be considered untainted by the desire of the mind to portray a certain narrative. This collection will seem authentic to an external observer, and it even almost does to me. But embellishment is the second step before a lie. The first is tone, already established. It paints a certain picture, does it not? Of a broken individual, desperately introspective, searching for meaning through a flawed medium.</p>
    <p>Except that is a fraction of the truth, and the presentation of such a shard as whole misleads.</p>
    <p>If you read any of my writings recently, or for any time, you will notice that I have become almost obsessive over the value of language. Moreso, its flaws. I know it must be like watching a broken clock, but in my defence, you know the saying that goes along with that phrase.</p>
    <p>Whilst it is my conflict of self that I cannot quantify the composition of shards that make me. One half of me, some smattering of shards, dictates that I should be happy to know this fact, for it is what goodness is. To possess an immutable soul is not admirable, it is a vice of stubbornness. Moreso, is that not what humanity affords us? A taste of the precise unfolding of nature's chaos, where beyond stating that we are our experiences, we can be our own paradoxes of inconceivable complexity. Eighty six billion neurons and we expect such a system to boil down to a few sentences? Now that must be arrogance.</p>
    <p>All of this is not to say that an impossible task should not be tackled. It is without persistence before the entropy of the everyday that we lay down as nothing more than incomplete stories. It is more an excuse to give when my self-analysis, my broad gestures about concepts I can never comprehend, inevitably fail. And an explanation that value isn't of the words themselves, but the thoughts had when producing them. A second layer that will never be captured again for neat redistribution.</p>
    <p>Then what does the other half of me feel right now? Not nothing, I should think, otherwise what words would I have to write? Yet nothing either strong enough to motivate me to act. That particular motivation has been sourced through unsustainable means as long as I've tried at anything. 
    <p>When I truly think about my other half. I thinkâ€¦ I think I see beauty.</p>
    <p>It is not then that my emotions are void, as muted as they are. Felt through a screen, my experiences are another's pain to burden and my empathy only for that person.</p>
    <p>The person who carries my pain must be strong, for they give me reprieve to look at the universe unclouded, and the mind is only one expression of the vastness of the visage. I have before fallen into the trap of despair, the most common reaction of one who thinks even a little upon their place. But this fog I now know so well restricts that.
    <p>Not enough that it doesn't attempt to poke in. Because behind that beauty is agony. Humanity has advanced so far in so many ways, and the forefront of our species has always been our capacity to harm one another in horrifying, terrible, beautiful ways. It's not possible to imagine a utopia filled with souls like ours, because a utopia could never be immutable nor variable enough to cater to the base chaos of souls like ours.</p>
    <p>Yet. As I see beauty in the soul, there is always Time. The impermanence of everything we are is nothing when confronted by the onslaught of the universal axis. When I next blink, I will never be the person I once was, for good or for not. When I next blink, I will have passed up the opportunity to shape the person I will be for no motivation fills me to affect that future. When I next blink, a day will pass. And another. And one more. And I will wake up to a world that has left me behind because I was too far disconnected from it to care. Perhaps then I will cry, as it's not Time that has truly been lost, but the person I could have been.</p>
